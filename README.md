The purpose of this search engine is to practice my cohesive python classes. This will
 include public methods, private methods, and data structures stored as fields. Additionally, 
 I will work with common indexing algorithms, and consider efficient ways to store data that will
  be frequently accessed by the TF-IDF algorithm.
